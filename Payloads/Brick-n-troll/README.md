REM TITLE: Brick-n-troll

REM AUTHOR: OSINTI4L (https://github.com/OSINTI4L)

REM TARGET OS: Linux (tested on Kali Linux) 

REM DESCRIPTION: Brick-n-troll will play the ["trololol" song & video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavMtUWDBTM) on max volume in full screen and then performs unauthenticated, recursive root file structure removal. Once root removal has begun, a text editor will open and print a "troll face" in ASCII art while the "trololol" song & video continue to play behind it.
